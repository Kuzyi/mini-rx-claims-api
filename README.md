# mini-rx-claims-api

This is a personal project to recreate a simplified pharmaceutical claims API using modern .NET technologies.  
The goal is to demonstrate core backend skillsâ€”such as CRUD operations, testing, authentication, and deploymentâ€”within a domain Iâ€™ve worked in professionally.

### ðŸ§© Key Features (Planned)
- RESTful endpoints for processing basic pharmacy claims
- Claim reject logic using standard NCPDP-style codes
- SQLite local dev database with EF Core
- Unit testing with xUnit
- Logging middleware with HIPAA-style considerations
- Optional Dapper refactor for performance comparison
- JWT-based auth (for 2FA demo later)
- CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions)
- Deployment to Azure (free tier)

### ðŸ§ª Status: In Progress
This is a work-in-progress project being built as part of a focused 90-day .NET job prep plan.  
You can follow its development [here](#) or via pinned updates on my GitHub profile.

_This project is inspired by my experience supporting a major U.S. pharmacy-benefit platform while working as a backend developer. All content here is built from scratch and does not contain any proprietary code._
